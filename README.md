## What is Nitro Sniper GUI?
Nitro Sniper GUI is a more friendly user interface for multiple Nitro Sniper Applications for Windows. 
Currently Nitro Sniper GUI includes the Rust and Go based Nitro Snipers without token or config files.

## How to use it?
1. When you download the release to any location that you wish, create/download the following files from [here](https://github.com/PeterStrick/NitroSniperGUI/tree/master/configfiles) to the location that you chose.

2. After you copied the config files, open the config files by opening the `Nitro Sniper GUI > Tools > Config Files` . and change the Token/MainToken variables to your Discord Token. You can find out how to get your Discord Token [here](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/wiki/Obtaining-Token-and-Channel-IDs#how-to-get-a-user-token)

3. Run NitroSniperGUI.exe

4. Once opened, go to ``Tools`` and start your Nitro Sniper.

## Did I get confirmation/permission to include the Nitro Snipers in my project?
Yes, indeed I did. See here:

## Disclaimer
This can get your account **permanently** banned if you run multiple instances at the same time and/or claim too much Nitros in a short amount of time.
I and the owners of the Nitro Snipers are **___not___** responsible in any **___damages or bans___** that may occur when using this application. **Use it at your own risk.**

## Info
Some Antivirus Products like AVG and Avast flag NitroSniperGUI.exe, rust-nitro-sniper.exe, go-nitro-sniper.exe and /dist/sniper/sniper.exe as [**IDP.Generic**](https://howandwow.info/idp-generic/), due to it being unsigned.
