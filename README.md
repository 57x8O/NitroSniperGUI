## To-Do
- [x] Add Snipers 
- [x] Change how to GUI handles Sniper Config Files to use Newtonsoft.JSON
- [x] Update to the New Version of Nitro Sniper GUI that requires said config rewrites
- [x] Move Config to Nitro Sniper GUI Settings instead of opening a config editor window
- [ ] Mabe try to make the GUI and snipers Linux/Wine compatible, because currently they aren't
